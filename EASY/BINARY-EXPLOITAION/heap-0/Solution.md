This challenges in order to win we have to overflow the buffer by inputing large ammount of values in the variable
Check 1. to see the 2 variable pico and bico
Check 2. Allows us to write our own block of data in the heap
	in this choice we need to utilize this to overflow the buffer
	maybe by inputing large random letter or numbers

Check 3. let us view the safevar, here we'll see the the safebar now contains our inputted data and see that it overflows due to our input

Check 4. the flag will now be displayed
